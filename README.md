# The Wedding Shop

## Concept
This Flask application is intended to create a simple solution to provide users a
user friendly portal and an API documentation.

It will be used to:
- Add a gift to the list
- Remove a gift from the list
- List the already added gifts of the list 
- Purchase a gift from the list
- Generate a report from the list which will print out the gifts and their statuses.
  - The report must include two sections:
    - Purchased gifts: each purchased gift with their details.
    - Not purchased gifts: each available gift with their details.
